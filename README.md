# FizzBuzz

## Overview
* This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "FizzBuzz" problem.
* In the FizzBuzz game, players take turns counting up from 1, but replace any number divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz" and any number divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz". If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it is replaced by "FizzBuzz".

## Usage
* Once the program is running, you will be prompted to enter a number. The program will then count up from 1 to the specified number, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz". The output will be displayed in the terminal/console.
